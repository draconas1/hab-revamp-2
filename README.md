# hab-revamp-2
Updating Habitat Revamp to Stellaris 2.1

This is a fork of the Habit Revamp mod by nodrogj that can be found on the steam workshop here: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1144318391

The original mod author stopped development after 1.8, I have attempted to update it to be 2.1 compatible.

As per the Paradox mod terms at https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/rules-for-user-made-mods-and-edits-of-pds-games.708039/ this Mod has no license of any kind.

None of the content in this mod is my own work, it was done either by Paradox Interactive or the original author nodrogj, this is purely a tweak to the code to make it function on 2.1.
